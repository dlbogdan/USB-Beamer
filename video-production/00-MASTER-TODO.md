- [ ] Add B-roll overlays
- [ ] Color correction/grading
- [ ] Audio mixing and leveling
- [ ] Add background music (ensure royalty-free)
- [ ] Add sound effects (subtle, for transitions)
- [ ] Create and add graphics/text overlays
- [ ] Add chapter markers
- [ ] Final watch-through

**Estimated Time**: 6-10 hours

### Graphics & Thumbnails

- [ ] Create end screen elements

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

---

## PUBLICATION (Day 8)

### YouTube Upload
- [ ] Export final video (4K recommended, or 1080p minimum)
- [ ] Write compelling title (A/B test ideas)
- [ ] Write detailed description (links, timestamps, resources)
- [ ] Add tags (Home Assistant, USB/IP, Zigbee, Z-Wave, etc.)
- [ ] Add to relevant playlists
- [ ] Set end screens and cards
- [ ] Create pinned comment with resources
- [ ] Schedule or publish

**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours

### Promotion
- [ ] Share on Reddit (r/homeassistant, r/selfhosted, etc.)
- [ ] Share on Home Assistant forums/Discord
- [ ] Share on Twitter/X
- [ ] Share on LinkedIn (if applicable)
- [ ] Post to personal blog/website (if applicable)
- [ ] Respond to early comments

**Estimated Time**: 1 hour

---

## TOTAL ESTIMATED TIME: 20-30 hours
**Realistic Timeline**: 7-10 days (part-time work)
**Aggressive Timeline**: 3-4 days (full-time focus)

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
✨ **Hook**: First 10 seconds must grab attention  
🎯 **Problem/Solution**: Clearly explain the pain point this solves  
🔧 **Demo**: Show it working live (not just talking about it)  
📊 **Value**: Emphasize Home Assistant use cases  
🚀 **Teaser**: Make viewers excited for next video (generic USB sharing)

---

## RESOURCES NEEDED
- [ ] **3D PRINTED CASE** - Assembled and polished (THIS IS THE HERO!)
- [ ] **3D PRINTING TIMELAPSE** - Video of case printing (if you have it)
- [ ] Raspberry Pi 3 A+ with USB-Beamer installed (inside the case)
- [ ] Compact USB hub and USB-C adapter (as shown in design)
- [ ] Home Assistant instance running (with USB Beamer addon installed)
- [ ] Z-Wave USB dongle
- [ ] Zigbee USB dongle
- [ ] USB-Beamer addon ready to demo (test the SSH key flow!)
- [ ] Fusion 360 project file (for screen recordings)
- [ ] Screen recording software (OBS, ScreenFlow, Camtasia)
- [ ] Video editing software (DaVinci Resolve, Premiere, Final Cut)
- [ ] Microphone (Blue Yeti, Shure SM7B, or similar)
- [ ] Camera (if doing talking head segments)
- [ ] **Good lighting for product shots** (softbox or ring light essential!)
- [ ] Turntable or lazy susan (for rotating case shots - optional but nice)
- [ ] Background music source (Epidemic Sound, Artlist, YouTube Audio Library)

## NOTES & IDEAS
- **LEAD WITH THE HARDWARE** - The 3D printed case immediately shows this is a polished, professional project
- Show the Fusion 360 design process to appeal to makers and engineers
- Include 3D printing timelapse for maker community appeal
- **EMPHASIZE WIFI SETUP** - The AP mode → phone setup → automatic connection is a killer feature
- Show the phone WiFi provisioning process clearly (very slick UX!)
- Consider showing "before/after" - bare Pi with cables vs. clean finished device
- Emphasize the zero-config addon experience (major selling point!)
- Show the SSH tunnel security aspect (encrypted communication)
- Demonstrate the auto-discovery via Avahi (no IP configuration needed)
- Show the clean web interface for WiFi management and SSH keys
- Emphasize the Buildroot custom Linux aspect (technical audience appeal)
- Mention Pi 3 A+ (WiFi-only) but compatible with Ethernet Pi models too
- Mention that case files (Fusion 360 + STL) are included in repo
- Tease the "universal" version coming in next video (Windows/Mac clients)
