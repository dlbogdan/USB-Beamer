## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### The First 10 Seconds
Your hook determines whether viewers keep watching. **Lead with the 3D printed case!** It immediately shows this is a polished, professional project.

### Show, Don't Just Tell
- ✅ **Open with hardware showcase** - 3D printed case rotating on screen
- ✅ **Show the design process** - Fusion 360 walkthrough
- ✅ **Demo the WiFi setup** - Phone screen recording of AP mode setup
- ✅ Live demos of devices connecting
- ✅ Screen recordings of actual usage
- ✅ Before/after comparisons (bare Pi vs. finished device)
- ❌ Just talking about features

### Technical Depth + Accessibility
- Explain WHY (USB/IP protocol, network advantages)
- Show HOW (actual commands, configuration)
- Keep it approachable (avoid unnecessary jargon)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Before You Start
1. **Test everything twice** - Demos that work once might fail on camera
2. **Back up footage immediately** - Don't lose hours of work to corruption
3. **Record room tone** - 30 seconds of silence helps with audio editing

### During Filming
1. **Slate each take** - Say "Take 1, Take 2" to make editing easier
2. **Record in segments** - Don't try to do the entire script in one take
3. **Get extra B-roll** - You'll use more than you think

### During Editing
1. **Cut ruthlessly** - If a section drags, cut it
2. **Watch with fresh eyes** - Take a day off before final review
3. **Get feedback early** - Show rough cuts to friends

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Today**: Read through all documents, customize the script
2. **This Week**: Schedule your production timeline, gather equipment
3. **Next Week**: Start filming!
