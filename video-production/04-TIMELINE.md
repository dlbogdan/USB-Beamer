## ⚡ AGGRESSIVE TIMELINE (If Needed)

For a compressed schedule (e.g., content sprint):

### Week 1: Full Production
- **Mon-Tue**: Pre-production (8h total)
- **Wed-Thu**: Filming (12h total)
- **Fri-Sun**: Editing (20h total)

### Week 2: Polish & Publish
- **Mon-Tue**: Final edits, thumbnail (6h total)
- **Wed**: Upload and promote (3h)

**Total**: 10 days, ~49 hours (intense but doable)

## 🎯 EFFICIENCY TIPS

### Batch Similar Tasks
- Record all A-roll in one session (maintain energy/consistency)
- Record all hardware shots in one session (keep lighting setup)
- Do all screen recordings together (same desktop theme/setup)

### Parallel Processing
- While Buildroot is building (takes 30-60 min), record B-roll
- While video is exporting (can take 30+ min), write description
- Upload video overnight (if large file)

### Avoid Perfectionism Traps
- Good enough is good enough (don't spend 2 hours on a 3-second transition)
- Ship it and iterate (feedback will guide improvement)
- Set hard deadlines for each phase

### Buffer Time
- Add 20% buffer to all estimates (things always take longer)
- Build in catch-up days (Day 7, Day 12)
- Don't schedule back-to-back sessions (burnout risk)

## 🔄 CONTINGENCY PLANS

### If You Fall Behind
1. **Trim scope**: Cut non-critical B-roll shots
2. **Simplify graphics**: Use simpler text overlays instead of complex animations
3. **Accept "good enough"**: Ship at 80% polish rather than delay

### If Technical Issues Arise
1. **Demo doesn't work**: Have backup recordings ready
2. **Equipment fails**: Have phone as backup camera/mic
3. **File corruption**: Back up footage immediately after recording

### If Life Happens
- Each day's work is modular—can skip a day and resume
- Weekend can absorb weekday delays
- Worst case: extend timeline by one week, no big deal

**Remember**: The perfect video never ships. The shipped video gets better with each iteration. Good luck! 🎬
